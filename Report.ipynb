    "       By using this data from Four Square we can do the exploratory analysis of data and group them based on their similarities. based on the venue data the districts have grouped by using a Machine Learning algorithm called K-means Algorithm. By finding the areas which are underdeveloped can help the persons who are trying to open venues in that particular District. And also by finding the areas which are developed can be used to get more insights about the district. We can know more about the district which are underdeveloped and it can give us enough information about the diffrent venues and based on that we can recommand a person to open a venue on that district."
